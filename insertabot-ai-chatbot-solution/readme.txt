== External Services ==

This plugin connects to the Insertabot API service to provide AI chatbot functionality.

**Service URL:** https://insertabot.io

**When the chatbot is enabled, the following data is transmitted:**
* User chat messages and questions
* Your website URL (for context)
* API key (for authentication)

**Third-Party Service Information:**
* Service Provider: Insertabot (https://insertabot.io)
* Privacy Policy: https://insertabot.io/privacy
* Terms of Service: https://insertabot.io/terms

The plugin requires an API key from Insertabot to function. You can obtain a free API key by signing up at https://insertabot.io/signup

**Backend Services Used by Insertabot API:**
* Cloudflare Workers AI (for AI processing)
* Tavily API (for real-time web search)

== Privacy ==

**Local Data Storage:**
Insertabot stores minimal data locally in your WordPress database:
* Encrypted API key (option: `insertabot_api_key_encrypted`)
* Plugin settings (enabled/disabled state, API base URL)
* Optional security logs (option: `insertabot_security_logs`) - anonymized with IP addresses masked

**Data Transmission:**
When users interact with the chatbot, their messages are sent to the Insertabot API service for processing. The plugin does **not** expose your API key to client browsers (uses short-lived tokens instead).

**GDPR Compliance:**
The plugin implements WordPress personal data exporters and erasers. Site administrators can export or remove personal data associated with a user via Tools → Export Personal Data / Erase Personal Data in WordPress admin.

**Security:**
* API keys are stored using AES-256-CBC encryption
* IP addresses in logs are anonymized (last octet/80 bits zeroed)
* No personal data is sent to third parties beyond what is necessary for chatbot functionality
